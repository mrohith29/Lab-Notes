The problem statement is the initial starting point for a project. It is basically a one to
three page statement that everyone on the project agrees with that describes what will be done
at a high level. The problem statement is intended for a broad audience and should be written
in nontechnical terms. It helps the non-technical and technical personnel communicate by
providing a description of a problem. It doesn't describe the solution to the problem. The
input to requirement engineering is the problem statement prepared by customer. It may give
an overview of the existing system along with broad expectations from the new system.

**1. Library Management System:**

Current library systems often struggle with efficient tracking of resources, leading to difficulties in locating materials, managing loans, and handling returns. This results in long wait times for patrons and increased workload for library staff. Furthermore, outdated systems may lack features like online catalogs, self-service options, and overdue fine management, hindering user experience and library operations. The absence of comprehensive reporting tools also limits the ability to analyze usage patterns, optimize resource allocation, and make informed decisions about collection development. An improved system is needed to streamline these processes, enhance accessibility, and provide a more user-friendly and efficient library experience.

**2. Railway Management System:**

Existing railway management systems frequently face challenges in optimizing train schedules, managing seat reservations, and providing real-time information to passengers. This can lead to overcrowding, delays, and passenger dissatisfaction. Inefficient resource allocation and a lack of integrated platforms for various services (ticketing, tracking, customer support) further complicate operations. Moreover, the systems may struggle to handle dynamic changes such as train cancellations or route diversions, leading to confusion and disruption. A modern solution is required to improve operational efficiency, enhance passenger communication, and ensure a seamless and reliable travel experience.

**3. Warehouse Management System:**

Many warehouses experience difficulties in efficiently managing inventory, tracking stock movement, and optimizing storage space. This results in misplaced items, inaccurate inventory counts, and increased operational costs. Manual processes and a lack of real-time visibility into warehouse operations contribute to delays in order fulfillment and difficulties in managing supply chains. Furthermore, existing systems may not effectively support advanced features like automated picking, cross-docking, and integration with other business systems. A comprehensive warehouse management system is needed to streamline operations, reduce errors, and improve overall productivity and efficiency.
