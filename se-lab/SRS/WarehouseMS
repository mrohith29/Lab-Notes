## Warehouse Management System

**1. Introduction**

* **1.1 Purpose:** This document outlines the requirements for a Warehouse Management System (WMS) to optimize and control warehouse operations, including inventory management, receiving, put-away, picking, packing, and shipping.
* **1.2 Scope:** The WMS will cover functionalities for managing inventory levels, tracking item locations, processing inbound and outbound shipments, generating reports, and potentially integrating with other supply chain systems.
* **1.3 Intended Audience:** This SRS is intended for warehouse managers, staff, system developers, testers, and potentially integration partners.
* **1.4 Definitions and Acronyms:**
    * WMS: Warehouse Management System
    * SKU: Stock Keeping Unit
    * RFID: Radio-Frequency Identification
    * EDI: Electronic Data Interchange
* **1.5 References:** (List any relevant documents, e.g., existing warehouse procedures, industry standards)

**2. Overall Description**

* **2.1 Product Perspective:** The WMS will be a web-based application accessible to warehouse staff through computers and potentially mobile devices (handheld scanners).
* **2.2 Product Functions:**
    * **Inventory Management:** Track inventory levels in real-time, manage item details (SKU, description, location, batch/serial numbers), and support cycle counting and physical inventory processes.
    * **Receiving:** Manage inbound shipments, verify received goods against purchase orders, and generate receiving documents.
    * **Put-Away:** Direct warehouse staff to optimal storage locations based on predefined rules and item characteristics.
    * **Picking:** Generate pick lists based on orders, optimize picking routes, and support various picking strategies (e.g., FIFO, LIFO).
    * **Packing:** Manage the packing process, generate packing slips, and potentially integrate with weighing scales and labeling systems.
    * **Shipping:** Manage outbound shipments, generate shipping labels, track shipments, and integrate with shipping carriers.
    * **Reporting and Analytics:** Generate reports on inventory levels, warehouse efficiency, order fulfillment rates, and other key performance indicators (KPIs).
    * **User Management:** Manage user accounts and roles with appropriate access permissions.
    * **Location Management:** Define and manage warehouse locations (zones, aisles, bins).
* **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics:**
    * **Warehouse Manager:** Full access to all system functionalities, including configuration, reporting, and user management.
    * **Warehouse Staff (Receiving, Put-Away, Picking, Packing, Shipping):** Access to specific modules relevant to their roles, potentially through handheld devices.
    * **Inventory Clerk:** Access to inventory management functionalities and report generation.
* **2.4 Operating Environment:** Web-based application accessible through standard web browsers. Potential mobile applications for handheld scanners (Android or Windows Mobile). Server environment details (operating system, database) to be specified.
* **2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints:** Integration with existing ERP or supply chain management systems, support for barcode scanners and potentially RFID readers, adherence to warehouse safety regulations.
* **2.6 User Documentation:** User manuals and training materials for different user roles.
* **2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies:** Reliable network connectivity within the warehouse, availability of necessary hardware (scanners, printers).

**3. Specific Requirements**

* **3.1 Functional Requirements:**
    * **FR01: Inventory Tracking:** The system shall track inventory levels in real-time, providing accurate information on the quantity and location of each item.
    * **FR02: Item Master Data:** The system shall allow users to maintain detailed information about each item (SKU, description, dimensions, weight, storage requirements, etc.).
    * **FR03: Receiving Management:** The system shall allow warehouse staff to record incoming shipments, match them against purchase orders, and update inventory levels upon receipt.
    * **FR04: Put-Away Management:** The system shall suggest optimal storage locations for received items based on predefined rules (e.g., item type,
    * **FR05: Picking Management:** The system shall generate pick lists based on customer orders or internal requests, optimize picking routes to minimize travel time, and allow staff to confirm picked items.
    * **FR06: Packing Management:** The system shall allow staff to record the packing of items into containers, generate packing slips, and potentially integrate with weighing scales and label printers.
    * **FR07: Shipping Management:** The system shall allow staff to manage outbound shipments, generate shipping labels, assign carriers, and track shipment status.
    * **FR08: Cycle Counting and Physical Inventory:** The system shall support cycle counting processes by allowing users to count specific inventory locations and reconcile the counts with system records. It should also support full physical inventory counts.
    * **FR09: Location Management:** The system shall allow administrators to define and manage warehouse locations, including zones, aisles, and bins, and associate items with specific locations.
    * **FR10: User Role Management:** The system shall provide different user roles with specific access permissions to ensure data security and operational control.
    * **FR11: Reporting and Analytics:** The system shall generate reports on key warehouse metrics such as inventory levels, order fulfillment rates, picking accuracy, and warehouse space utilization.
    * **FR12: Integration with External Systems (Optional):** The system may integrate with ERP systems for purchase order and sales order data, and with shipping carrier systems for tracking information.
    * **FR13: Barcode/RFID Support:** The system shall support barcode scanning for item identification and location management. It may optionally support RFID technology.
* **3.2 Non-Functional Requirements:**
    * **3.2.1 Performance Requirements:** The system shall provide quick response times for all operations, especially during peak periods. It should be able to handle a large volume of transactions.
    * **3.2.2 Security Requirements:** The system shall protect sensitive inventory data and operational information from unauthorized access. Secure login mechanisms and role-based access control shall be implemented.
