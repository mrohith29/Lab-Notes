## Unified Library Management System

**1. Introduction**

* **1.1 Purpose:** This document outlines the requirements for a Unified Library Management System (ULMS) aimed at automating and streamlining library operations, improving efficiency, and enhancing user experience.
* **1.2 Scope:** The ULMS will encompass functionalities for managing library resources (books, journals, digital media), member information, circulation (borrowing, returning, renewals), cataloging, reporting, and potentially inter-library loan management.
* **1.3 Intended Audience:** This SRS is intended for stakeholders including library administrators, staff, system developers, testers, and end-users.
* **1.4 Definitions and Acronyms:**
    * ULMS: Unified Library Management System
    * ISBN: International Standard Book Number
    * RFID: Radio-Frequency Identification
    * OPAC: Online Public Access Catalog
* **1.5 References:** (List any relevant documents, e.g., existing system documentation, relevant standards)

**2. Overall Description**

* **2.1 Product Perspective:** The ULMS will be a web-based application accessible to library staff and members through standard web browsers. It may also include mobile applications for certain functionalities.
* **2.2 Product Functions:**
    * **Catalog Management:** Add, update, and manage library resources with detailed information (title, author, publisher, ISBN, subject, keywords, publication year, etc.). Support for different resource types (books, journals, DVDs, e-books).
    * **Member Management:** Register new members, update member details, manage membership types, track borrowing history, and handle fines.
    * **Circulation Management:** Facilitate borrowing, returning, and renewing of resources. Manage loan periods, overdue items, and holds/reservations.
    * **OPAC (Online Public Access Catalog):** Allow members to search the library catalog, check availability, place holds, and manage their accounts.
    * **Reporting and Analytics:** Generate reports on various aspects like circulation statistics, popular resources, overdue items, and member activity.
    * **Security and Authentication:** Secure access for different user roles (administrator, librarian, member) with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    * **System Administration:** Manage user accounts, system settings, and backups.
* **2.3 User Classes and Characteristics:**
    * **Library Administrator:** Full access to all system functionalities, including user management, configuration, and reporting.
    * **Librarian:** Access to cataloging, circulation, member management, and report generation.
    * **Library Member:** Access to OPAC for searching, placing holds, viewing their account, and potentially renewing items.
* **2.4 Operating Environment:** Web-based application compatible with standard web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge). Potential mobile applications for iOS and Android. Server environment details (operating system, database) to be specified.
* **2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints:** Adherence to accessibility guidelines (WCAG), data privacy regulations, and potential integration with existing library systems.
* **2.6 User Documentation:** User manuals, online help, and FAQs for both staff and members.
* **2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies:** Reliable network connectivity, availability of necessary hardware infrastructure.

**3. Specific Requirements**

* **3.1 Functional Requirements:**
    * **FR01: Cataloging:** The system shall allow librarians to add new resources with detailed metadata, categorize resources by subject and genre, and manage multiple copies of the same resource.
    * **FR02: Member Registration:** The system shall allow administrators and librarians to register new members, capturing personal details, contact information, and membership type.
    * **FR03: Borrowing:** The system shall allow librarians to record the borrowing of resources, associate them with a member, and track the due date.
    * **FR04: Returning:** The system shall allow librarians to record the return of resources and update their availability status.
    * **FR05: Renewal:** The system shall allow members (through OPAC) and librarians to renew borrowed resources within defined limits.
    * **FR06: Holds/Reservations:** The system shall allow members (through OPAC) to place holds on unavailable resources, and notify them when the resource becomes available.
    * **FR07: Search Functionality (OPAC):** The system shall provide robust search functionality based on keywords, title, author, ISBN, subject, etc., with filtering and sorting options.
    * **FR08: Fine Management:** The system shall automatically calculate fines for overdue items and allow librarians to manage fine payments.
    * **FR09: Reporting:** The system shall generate reports on circulation statistics (e.g., number of items borrowed, returned), popular resources, overdue items, member demographics, etc.
    * **FR10: User Authentication:** The system shall securely authenticate users (librarians and members) before granting access to relevant functionalities.
    * **FR11: User Role Management:** The system shall enforce role-based access control, ensuring users can only access authorized features.
    * **FR12: Inter-Library Loan (Optional):** The system may support managing requests for resources from other libraries.
    * **FR13: Digital Resource Management (Optional):** The system may support managing access to e-books, journals, and other digital resources.
* **3.2 Non-Functional Requirements:**
    * **3.2.1 Performance Requirements:** The system shall respond to user requests within an acceptable timeframe (e.g., search results within 3 seconds). The system should be able to handle a specified number of concurrent users.
    * **3.2.2 Security Requirements:** The system shall protect sensitive member data and library information from unauthorized access. Secure authentication and authorization mechanisms shall be implemented.
    * **3.2.3 Usability Requirements:** The system shall be user-friendly and intuitive for both library staff and members. The OPAC should be easily navigable.
    * **3.2.4 Reliability Requirements:** The system shall be available for a specified percentage of time (e.g., 99.9% uptime). Data backups and recovery mechanisms shall be in place.
    * **3.2.5 Scalability Requirements:** The system should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of resources and members.
    * **3.2.6 Maintainability Requirements:** The system should be designed in a modular and well-documented manner to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.
* **3.3 External Interface Requirements:**
    * **3.3.1 User Interfaces:** Web-based interface for staff and members, potential mobile applications.
    * **3.3.2 Hardware Interfaces:** Compatibility with barcode scanners, RFID readers (optional).
